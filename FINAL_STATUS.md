# ✅ Your App is Ready!

## 🎉 What's Done

Your sign language recognition website is **fully built** and **running**!

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Development server running at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ UI complete (upload, camera, results display)
- ✅ TensorFlow.js integrated
- ⏳ **Just need to add the model files**

## 🎯 Final Step: Convert Your Model

Since you don't have Python/Visual Studio, use **Google Colab** (takes 2 minutes):

### Quick Steps:

1. **Open**: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. **Follow**: The guide in `CONVERT_WITH_COLAB.md`
3. **Download**: tfjs_model.zip
4. **Extract** to: `D:\SIH\sanket\public\tfjs_model\`
5. **Refresh** your browser at http://localhost:3000

That's it! 🚀

## 🧪 Testing Your App Right Now

Even without the model, you can test the UI:

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000
2. **See**: Beautiful landing page with "Recognize Sign Language Instantly"
3. **Try**: Upload tab and Camera tab (UI works perfectly)
4. **Note**: Predictions will fail until model is added
